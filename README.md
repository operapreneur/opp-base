The methods, docs, snippets, libraries, frameworks, etc., are ever evolving along with my philosophy behind using them. This repository will be utilized as a study, a conversation point and, for me, a recorded history of my process and pursuit of perfection.

> Within the pursuit of perfection lies the desire to become enlightened or changed. If that impulse is not present within the work, then the work is inherently pointless.

# Development Approach

My grandfather was a mechanic and entrepreneur and my father a cement finisher. They passed on their love of solving problems and building things to me. However, when I've helped them out I always repeated the phrase, **'work smart, not hard'**, in response to the way they approached their work.

My grandmothers and mother encouraged/nurtured my creative side. They were the reason that I became a musician and opera singer, specifically. As a musician, I developed a keen sense of observing and reacting to micro and macro moments in live performance. Music is a complex language on paper and **requires both technique, collaboration, and creativity.**

The combination of these life experiences continue to influence my approach to development. I am constantly exploring and adapting my process as a developer to fit the project at hand.

### Design Systems

Design systems, style guides, and pattern libraries are a cornerstone of the rapidly changing web. The benefits are well-discussed in [Brad Frost's Atomic Design](https://github.com/operapreneur/opp-base):

- Consistency and cohesion
- Shared vocabulary
- Education
- Empathetic workflow
- Testing
- Speed
- Caring about the future

### CSS

Using SASS is a must have in every project. I have nothing against LESS and find it interesting that it is in Javascript but the majority of teams I've worked for always use SASS.

I've laid out the philosophy behind my [SASS folder structure and CSS methodology.](https://github.com/operapreneur/opp-base/blob/master/docs/css.md)
